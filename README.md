Lab 4 : WEB DEVELOPMENT

This repository contains solutions to three questions for a web development lab using HTML and JavaScript. Each question demonstrates basic JavaScript functionalities such as DOM manipulation, user input handling, and loops.

## Live Previews

- [Question 1 - Change Paragraph Text](https://aarani07.github.io/lab4_webdevelopment/question1.html)  
  This page changes the text of a paragraph using JavaScript after the page loads.

- [Question 2 - Number Checker](https://aarani07.github.io/lab4_webdevelopment/question2.html)  
  This page allows users to input a number and checks whether it is higher or lower than 10.

- [Question 3 - JavaScript Loop Example](https://aarani07.github.io/lab4_webdevelopment/question3.html)  
  This page displays numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop and shows them in a paragraph.

## How it works

Each .html file contains:
- Basic HTML structure (<html>, <head>, <body>)
- JavaScript for interaction and logic
- DOM manipulation using getElementById and getElementsByTagName

These files are deployed using *GitHub Pages*, which allows static websites to be hosted directly from this repository.
